    <section id="abstract"><p><strong><em>Abstract- </em><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We propose a novel method for predicting the winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture by analyzing the number of coughs and sneezes in the nominated films. By comparing these expulsion quantities to the public’s current interest in seeing coughs and sneezes (“The Coughgeist”), we are able to predict the winner of Best Picture with 83% accuracy. Our Coughgeist-based prediction model takes into effect multiple factors including genre, prominence of expulsion, and whether or not a leading actor has played or will play Batman.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></strong></p></section>

    Introduction</h2>
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Every year, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awards a “Best Picture.” And every year, enormous amounts of time, effort, and money are spent attempting to predict it. <a href=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/2/21/18229512/oscar-campaigns-for-your-consideration-events-narratives-weinstein>Studios spend millions of dollars</a> to produce and promote films that they think will win. And individuals spend millions of dollars betting on the outcome. Current small-minded attempts at prediction are driven by methods ranging from intuition to historical analysis to <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30130762>discrete choice models</a>. However, they all fall short in terms of reliable predictions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We propose a novel approach: leveraging years of research and cutting-edge statistical models to predict which film will win Best Picture based on the number of coughs and sneezes in it.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section>
    <section id="methods-and-materials"><h2>II.
    Methods and Materials</h2>
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In our work analyzing over thirty thousand films for <a href=https://everymoviecough.com/>Every Movie Cough</a>, the world’s most complete collection of cinematic coughs and sneezes, we discovered a striking pattern: films with coughs and sneezes in them tend to be more likely to be nominated for Best Picture. 43% of all films have coughs and sneezes but 64% of Best Picture nominees have coughs and sneezes. Perhaps this is because coughs and sneezes can often signal drama, action, or impending illness, the sort of moments that award-winning films are made of. Regardless of the cause, the potential of using coughs and sneezes for predicting a winner is highly promising.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure><p>Table 1</p>

We then search these subtitles for instances of phrases like “cough,” “coughing,” and “a-choo,” correcting for false positives like a character saying “cough it up.” We occasionally supplement this approach with human analysis of films, but depend on it less following the indignant resignation of our postdoctoral fellow.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->true<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We prefer subtitles over machine-learning-based detection because the presence of a cough in subtitles means it was prominent enough for a person to write it down.

    Results</h2>
  <h3><strong><em>A. Do Movies with More Coughs Win More Oscars?</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->According to the entrenched mainstream statistical hegemony, no. There is no simple relationship between expulsions and awards. But we believe that in what some may call “noise” and a “waste of department resources” lies a revolutionary prediction model, one which synthesizes numerous factors to predict winners with staggering accuracy.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><h3><strong><em>B. The Coughgeist</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We postulate that the public appetite for coughs and sneezes in movies varies from year to year. We call this appetite “The Coughgeist.” The nominated movie that comes closest to providing the same number of coughs and sneezes as the Coughgeist tends to win Best Picture.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><h3><strong><em>C. Calculating the Coughgiest</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Using that data, we calculate the Coughgeist by taking the median expulsions for the nominees and normalizing it.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Our dataset starts at 2009, the year when the field of nominees was nearly doubled, allowing for a much more accurate calculation of the Coughgeist.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->[Fig 2. Graph showing the Coughgeist over time]<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As can be seen, the Coughgeist varies over time. We can see that in 2020 the Coughgeist was higher than ever, driven most likely by the COVID-19 pandemic.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Once the coughs and sneezes of the nominees are compared and adjusted for genre and Batman-related factors (see below), the Coughgeist becomes a reliable predictor for the winner.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><h3><strong><em>D. Films with Too Many Coughs</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Films that exceed the Coughgeist never win. We posit that this is because audiences are repulsed by the overabundance of coughing and sneezing and find a film less enjoyable as a result.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="svelte-crodsb"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mTr2WtrYlqk/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="coughs in the film The Revenant">

</figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Interestingly, an overabundance of expulsions does not hamper the chances of the actor or actress doing the coughing to win their own Oscar, as evidenced by Best Actor wins for Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant and Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><h3><strong><em>E. Films with Too Few Coughs</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Conversely, films that fail to meet the Coughgeist tend to lose as well. We posit that these films feel unrealistic and off-putting in their paucity of expulsions compared to the expectations of the current moment.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="svelte-crodsb"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UcasnEMs30Q/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="coughs in the film Sound of Metal">

</figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While beyond our remit as data scientists, we cannot help but feel sympathy for the directors who labored for years against naysayers only to have their dreams dispassionately suffocated by gatekeepers simply because of a few coughs and sneezes.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><h3><strong><em>F. Films with Just the Right Amount of Coughs</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Films that have the exact same number of expulsions as the Coughgeist tend to win. By meeting audience expectations for coughs and sneezes exactly, victory is assured.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="svelte-crodsb"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BG0VIn-Wn6k/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="coughs in the film Nomadland">

</figure><h3><strong><em>G. The Thriller Tripler Effect</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In 2019, many were stunned by the victory of foreign-language thriller Parasite. Explanations included the rise of streaming platforms, the expansion of the Academy’s membership, and that it simply was the best film. At first glance, it appears to defy the Coughgeist as well, with 9 expulsions in a 3 expulsion year. But we know from our prior research that coughs in thrillers outpace coughs in non-thriller dramas. And indeed, looking at the dataset, we can see the winning thrillers continue this trend, in this case tripling the unadjusted Coughgeist. Simply put, because audiences expect more coughs and sneezes from thrillers, we normalize their number of expulsions by dividing by three.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Once we factor in this effect, we can easily predict the victories of Parasite, The Shape of Water, and The Hurt Locker.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="svelte-crodsb"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DnwAZA965MQ/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="coughs in the film Parasite">

</figure><h3><strong><em>H. Tiebreaking</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There are cases in which more than one film in a year will meet the Coughgeist exactly. In these cases, we find two criteria helpful for choosing the winner:<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->1. Prominence of expulsions. When expulsions are clearly foregrounded, they tend to help a film win. For example, Nomadland and Trial of the Chicago 7 both had 4 expulsions, but Nomadland’s happened prominently while Trial of the Chicago 7’s happened in the background.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->[Fig 14. Comparison of Nomadland and Trial of the Chicago 7]<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->2. Critical reception. Often, when two films are tied for number of expulsions, the one with better reviews on Metacritic wins.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When the Coughgeist is used in concert with the Thriller Tripler Effect and proper tiebreaking, we can predict Best Picture winners with an accuracy level 34% greater than random chance. A significant achievement certainly, but we can do better.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><h3><strong><em>I. The Batman Effect</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We notice that abnormalities in our framework tend to occur when a movie has no coughs and stars an actor who has played or will play Batman. For example, Argo starring Ben Affleck won with 0 coughs in 2012 when the Coughgeist was 2. And Spotlight starring Michael Keaton won with 0 coughs in 2015 when the Coughgeist was also 2. It appears there is a clear Batman Effect at play: when a movie has no coughs, having a lead actor who has played or will play Batman is worth 2 coughs.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While the effect is apparent, the underlying cause likely requires further research. We believe it may be because audiences associate Batman with a deep, gravely voice, a voice whose net effect over a full feature film is not dissimilar to the effect of 2 coughs. This 2 cough halo then extends over the actor’s other work.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“But wasn’t Michael Keaton’s voice in Batman less gravely?” a nettlesome reader may ask. Certainly, but Spotlight was released after the Dark Knight trilogy, which starred the exceptionally-gravelly Christian Bale. Due to the fallibility of memory, audiences likely associated any Batman with the dominant Batman of the epoch, leading to an association of Keaton with Bale’s performance.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“But then why does this effect not apply to Birdman?” the reader may continue, jealously sneering from his corner office with windows in the new part of the statistics building that doesn’t smell like mildew. First, Birdman has a cough of its own, negating the effect. Second, Birdman references Keaton’s past as Batman, breaking any subconscious effect upon the audience.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->[Fig 15. Evidence of gravelly speech and coughs in Batman films]<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><h3><strong><em>J: Predicting This Year’s Winner</em></strong></h3><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Both betting markets and entertainment journalists currently favor The Power of The Dog and Belfast for Best Picture. However, both of these films are too coughy for the 2021 Coughgeist of 2.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="svelte-crodsb"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AaO3je1AvFs/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="coughs in the film Belfast">

  <figcaption class="svelte-crodsb">Fig. 17 The Power of the Dog has 3 coughs</figcaption>
</figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Based on the Coughgeist, either Dune or Licorice Pizza should win, as both those films have 2 expulsions. A close examination of the two films shows that both coughs in Dune are prominently featured, while one cough in Licorice Pizza is a background cough. Therefore we can say with a high degree of certainty that Dune will be this year’s Best Picture winner. We are proud to be the first to congratulate the producers and lead cougher ​​Timothée Chalamet.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure class="svelte-crodsb"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1-hIZCiNZds/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="coughs in the film Dune">

  <div class="page svelte-1dfjbbe"><section id="discussion"><h2>IV.
    Discussion</h2>
  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->While our Coughgeist model has achieved a revolutionary 83% correct prediction rate, we believe further improvement could be made by studying the films that fail to conform to it: Green Book and The King’s Speech. It may be that further genre adjustments are needed. We see hints at a Biographical Normalization Effect, in which biographical films may need to have 1.5 expulsions added to them, perhaps because actors, out of respect for their real-life characters, don’t want to make them appear too sick.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Or perhaps these outliers are due to Extended Batman Effects: Helena Bonham Carter’s 13-year relationship with Batman director Tim Burton could explain The King’s Speech’s victory. Or, more likely, The King’s Speech may have won because Colin Firth will play Batman at some point in the future. This striking conclusion points to the possibility of the Coughgeist being able to predict more than just Academy Awards and demands further well-funded research and the creation of new tenure-tracked faculty positions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></section>
