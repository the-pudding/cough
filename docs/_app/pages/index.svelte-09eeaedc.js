It appears there is a clear Batman Effect at play: when a movie has no coughs, having a lead actor who has played or will play Batman is worth 2 coughs."},{type:"text",value:"While the effect is apparent, the underlying cause likely requires further research. We believe it may be because audiences associate Batman with a deep, gravely voice, a voice whose net effect over a full feature film is not dissimilar to the effect of 2 coughs.

Certainly, but Spotlight was released after the Dark Knight trilogy, which starred the exceptionally-gravelly Christian Bale. Due to the fallibility of memory, audiences likely associated any Batman with the dominant Batman of the epoch, leading to an association of Keaton with Bale\u2019s performance."},{type:"text",value:"\u201CBut then why does this effect not apply to Birdman?\u201D the reader may continue, jealously sneering from his corner office with windows in the new part of the statistics building that doesn\u2019t smell like mildew.

It may be that further genre adjustments are needed. We see hints at a Biographical Normalization Effect, in which biographical films may need to have 1.5 expulsions added to them, perhaps because actors, out of respect for their real-life characters, don\u2019t want to make them appear too sick."},{type:"text",value:"Or perhaps these outliers are due to Extended Batman Effects: Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s 13-year relationship with Batman director Tim Burton could explain The King\u2019s Speech\u2019s victory.
