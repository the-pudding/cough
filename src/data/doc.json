A Revelatory Prediction Model Using Expulsion Analysis.","authors":["Mike Lacher","Jason Eppink","Russell Goldenberg"],"institution":"Unaffiliated Associate Adjunct Professors","abstract":"We propose a novel method for predicting the winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture by analyzing the number of coughs and sneezes in the nominated films. By comparing these expulsion quantities to the public’s current interest in seeing coughs and sneezes (“The Coughgeist”), we are able to predict the winner of Best Picture with 83% accuracy. Our Coughgeist-based prediction model takes into effect multiple factors including genre, prominence of expulsion, and whether or not a leading actor has played or will play Batman.","keywords":"tk, tk, tk, tk, tk","introduction":[{"type":"text","value":"Every year, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awards a “Best Picture.” And every year, enormous amounts of time, effort, and money are spent attempting to predict it. <a href=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/2/21/18229512/oscar-campaigns-for-your-consideration-events-narratives-weinstein>Studios spend millions of dollars</a> [1] to produce and promote films that they think will win.

Perhaps this is because coughs and sneezes can often signal drama, action, or impending illness, the sort of moments that award-winning films are made of. Regardless of the cause, the potential of using coughs and sneezes for predicting a winner is highly promising."},{"type":"table","value":"Materials"},{"type":"break","value":"true"},{"type":"text","value":"Our dataset of coughs and sneezes comes from analyzing user-created subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired (SDH) from OpenSubtitles.org.

But we know from our prior research that coughs in thrillers outpace coughs in non-thriller dramas.

It appears there is a clear Batman Effect at play: when a movie has no coughs, having a lead actor who has played or will play Batman is worth 2 coughs."},{"type":"text","value":"While the effect is apparent, the underlying cause likely requires further research. We believe it may be because audiences associate Batman with a deep, gravely voice, a voice whose net effect over a full feature film is not dissimilar to the effect of 2 coughs. This 2 cough halo then extends over the actor’s other work."},{"type":"text","value":"“But wasn’t Michael Keaton’s voice in Batman less gravely?” a nettlesome reader may ask. Certainly, but Spotlight was released after the Dark Knight trilogy, which starred the exceptionally-gravelly Christian Bale.

It may be that further genre adjustments are needed. We see hints at a Biographical Normalization Effect, in which biographical films may need to have 1.5 expulsions added to them, perhaps because actors, out of respect for their real-life characters, don’t want to make them appear too sick."},{"type":"text","value":"Or perhaps these outliers are due to Extended Batman Effects: Helena Bonham Carter’s 13-year relationship with Batman director Tim Burton could explain The King’s Speech’s victory. Or, more likely, The King’s Speech may have won because Colin Firth will play Batman at some point in the future. This striking conclusion points to the possibility of the Coughgeist being able to predict more than just Academy Awards and demands further well-funded research and the creation of new tenure-tracked faculty positions."}],"conclusions":[{"type":"text","value":"Conclusion graf(s) here"}],"acknowledgement":[{"type":"text","value":"Acknowledgement graf(s) here"}],"references":[{"author":"Wilkinson, Alissa","year":"2019","title":"How to win an Oscar","url":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/2/21/18229512/oscar-campaigns-for-your-consideration-events-narratives-weinstein"},{"author":"Pardoe, Iain, Simonton, Dean","year":"2008","title":"Applying Discrete Choice Models to Predict Academy Award Winners","url":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/30130762"}]}
