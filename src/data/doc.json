Current, small-minded attempts at prediction are driven by methods including the analysis of IMDb communities [2], sentiment analysis of Twitter [3], <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30130762>discrete choice models</a> [4], and subjective Bayesian predictive conditional approaches to synthesize historical data [5].

Regardless of the cause, the potential of using coughs and sneezes for predicting a winner is highly promising."},{"type":"table","value":"Analysis"},{"type":"text","value":"Our dataset of coughs and sneezes comes from analyzing user-created subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired (SDH) from OpenSubtitles.org.

It hit an all time high at the 94th Academy Awards, which honored films released in 2020 and the beginning of 2021.

At first glance, it appears to defy the Coughgeist as well, with nine expulsions in a three expulsion year. But we know from our prior research that coughs in thrillers outpace coughs in non-thriller dramas. And indeed, looking at the dataset, we can see the winning thrillers continue this trend, in this case tripling the unadjusted Coughgeist. Simply put, because audiences expect more coughs and sneezes from thrillers, we normalize their number of expulsions by dividing by three."},{"type":"text","value":"Once we factor in this effect, we can easily predict the victories of <em>Parasite, The Shape of Water</em>, and <em>The Hurt Locker</em>."},{"type":"video","value":{"id":"DnwAZA965MQ","fig":"12","film":"Parasite","caption":"Parasite’s nine coughs are equal to three coughs from a non-thriller"}},{"type":"break","value":"true"},{"type":"video","value":{"id":"woVNpQIkXh0","fig":"13","film":"The Shape of Water","caption":"The Shape of Water’s three coughs are equal to one cough from a non-thriller"}},{"type":"video","value":{"id":"1eyBt72cAuY","fig":"14","film":"The Hurt Locker","caption":"The Hurt Locker’s three coughs"}},{"type":"hed","value":"H.

For example, Argo starring Ben Affleck won with zero coughs when the Coughgeist was two. And Spotlight starring Michael Keaton won with zero coughs when the Coughgeist was also two. It appears there is a clear Batman Effect at play: when a movie has no coughs, having a lead actor who has played or will play Batman is worth two coughs."},{"type":"text","value":"While the effect is apparent, the underlying cause likely requires further research. We believe it may be because audiences associate Batman with a deep, gravely voice, a voice whose net effect over a full feature film is not dissimilar to the effect of two coughs. This two cough halo then extends over the actor’s other expulsionless work."},{"type":"text","value":"“But wasn’t Michael Keaton’s voice in Batman less gravely?” a nettlesome reader may ask. Certainly, but Spotlight was released after the Dark Knight trilogy, which starred the exceptionally-gravelly Christian Bale.

First, Birdman has a cough of its own, negating the effect. Second, Birdman references Keaton’s past as Batman, breaking any subconscious effect upon the audience."},{"type":"text","value":"[Fig 15.

We believe this may be an indicator of Extended Batman Effects. Mahershala Ali was up for Commissioner Gordon in The Batman. Or, more likely, Green Book may have won because Viggo Mortensen will play Batman at some point in the future. This striking conclusion points to the possibility of the Coughgeist being able to predict more than just Academy Awards and demands further well-funded research and the creation of new tenure-track faculty positions."}],"conclusions":[{"type":"text","value":"Our model shows that analyzing the number of coughs and sneezes in the nominees for Best Picture makes predicting a winner possible with 91.7% accuracy. While at first glance of the data, a close-minded department chair may give a tenured scoff, we believe accounting for multiple factors yields a striking model. We first establish the public’s appetite for coughs with the Coughgeist, then account for genre with the Thriller Tripler Effect, then break ties using expulsion prominence and critical reception, and finally normalize using the striking Batman Effect. Further refining of this model may yield not only a better means of predicting Best Picture winner, but a better means of predicting numerous aspects related to feature films, including the casting of future Batmen."}],"editorsnote":[{"type":"text","value":"The claims in this paper have not been verified because the researchers have refused to yield their full dataset and methodology, citing “intellectual property rights,” “the extreme sanctity of the first amendment,” and “the Wright brothers never had to show their work.” We are publishing their paper here because they won’t stop mailing hard copies in triplicate to our homes and offices."}],"acknowledgements":[{"type":"text","value":"Many thanks to Museum of the Moving Image for their visionary support in commissioning Every Movie Cough and to OpenSubtitles for generously sharing their subtitle collection with us."},{"type":"text","value":"No thanks to our former postdoctoral fellows and department administrators at the University of Central Florida."}],"references":[{"author":"Wilkinson, Alissa","year":"2019","title":"How to win an Oscar","url":"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/2/21/18229512/oscar-campaigns-for-your-consideration-events-narratives-weinstein"},{"author":"J.
